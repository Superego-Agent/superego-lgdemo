# Async SQLite Fix for Superego

## The Problem

The error you're experiencing:

```
Error (set: general): Streaming error: The SqliteSaver does not support async methods. Consider using AsyncSqliteSaver instead.
from langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite.aio import AsyncSqliteSaver
Note: AsyncSqliteSaver requires the aiosqlite package to use.
Install with: `pip install aiosqlite`
```

This happens because:
1. The FastAPI backend is using async methods (specifically `astream_events` in the streaming endpoints)
2. But the `SqliteSaver` in `superego_core.py` is synchronous, causing a mismatch when async operations attempt to access it

## The Solution

I've created two new files that use the async versions of SQLite components:

1. `superego_core_async.py` - An async version of the core functionality that:
   - Imports `AsyncSqliteSaver` instead of `SqliteSaver`
   - Uses `aiosqlite` instead of `sqlite3`
   - Makes `create_workflow` an async function with proper `await` syntax
   - Maintains all other functionality exactly as before

2. `backend_server_async.py` - An async-compatible version of the backend server that:
   - Imports from `superego_core_async` instead of `superego_core`
   - Uses `await` for all checkpoint operations
   - Properly handles async DB queries for thread listing and history loading
   - Maintains the same API endpoints and functionality

## Using the Async Version

To use the async version:

```bash
# Make sure aiosqlite is installed
pip install aiosqlite

# Run the async backend server
python backend_server_async.py
```

The frontend doesn't need any changes as it interacts with the same API endpoints.

## Why This Approach?

This approach:

1. **Minimizes changes** - We created parallel files rather than modifying existing ones, allowing you to easily switch between versions
2. **Preserves functionality** - All features (normal chat, compare mode, etc.) continue to work the same way
3. **Follows best practices** - Uses proper async/await patterns throughout the codebase
4. **Matches LangGraph recommendations** - Implements their suggested solution with AsyncSqliteSaver

## What Would Break Without This Fix

Without this fix:
1. Streaming responses would fail with the error you're seeing
2. Thread history might be corrupted or inaccessible
3. New messages wouldn't be properly saved to the database

The async fix ensures all database operations are properly handled while maintaining the streaming architecture that makes the application responsive.
