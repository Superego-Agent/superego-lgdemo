Hi Clive! Please look in this repo - ALL the docs for langgraph are in here. 

Look at @/docs/llms.txt for a quick index of the available documentation, or look at the folder structure. 

Look at @/project-requirements.md to find out about the app I want to code. 

Please ONLY follow the implementation as outlined in the docs. Do not 'remember' how to implement langgraph from your own memory, instead do things the way they are done in the docs. This will require extensive reference to the how-tos/'docs' sections of the docs, specifically on multi-agent flows. The code should not be too bulky. 

I have provided a data folder with default constitutions and system_instructions. I have also created a .env with an ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.
