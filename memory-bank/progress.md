# Progress: Superego LangGraph Agent (As of 2025-04-10 ~12:35 AM)

## 1. What Works / Completed

*   **Core Backend Concept (CLI):** Initial CLI version exists.
*   **Basic Moderation:** Superego agent concept exists.
*   **Pluggable Inner Agent:** Architecture supports this.
*   **Frontend Foundation:** SvelteKit project setup exists.
*   **Frontend State Refactor (Steps 1-6 Completed):**
    *   Verified `stores.ts` (`threadCacheStore`).
    *   Refactored `api.ts` (cache integration, SSE handling).
    *   Verified `streamProcessor.ts`.
    *   Created `ChatView.svelte`.
    *   Refactored `ChatInterface.svelte` (delegation to `ChatView`, pagination layout).
*   **Constitution Handling & Sending Logic Refactor (Completed):**
    *   Created `globalConstitutionsStore.ts` and integrated loading.
    *   Verified `ConstitutionSelector.svelte` uses stores and dispatches config.
    *   Created `chatService.ts` to manage config state and API calls.
    *   Updated `ChatInterface.svelte` to use `chatService`.
*   **Backend API:** Verified constitution endpoints in `api_routers/constitutions.py`.
*   **Plan Documentation:** Updated `refactor_plan.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
*   **`MessageCard.svelte` Refactor:** Updated component to use correct `MessageType` properties (`type`, `nodeId`) and type guards.
*   **`svelte-check` Fixes:** Addressed various errors/warnings (unused CSS, accessibility, TS errors) across multiple frontend components (`Sidebar`, `ConstitutionInfoModal`, `AddConstitutionModal`, `ConstitutionSelector`, `CompareInterface`, `ConstitutionDropdown`).
*   **Backend SSE Fixes:** Resolved `NameError` issues in `api_routers/runs.py` and `api_routers/threads.py` related to missing imports (`SSERunStartData`, `SSEErrorData`, `SSEChunkData`, `HumanApiMessageModel`, `json`) and incorrect type validation.

## 2. What's Left / In Progress

*   **Frontend State Refactor (Completed):**
    *   Steps 1-6 completed previously.
    *   Step 7 (Constitution Handling & Sending Logic):
        *   Verified `ConstitutionSelector.svelte` functionality.
        *   Created `chatService.ts` for config state and API calls.
        *   Updated `ChatInterface.svelte` to use `chatService`.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test the refactored frontend workflows.
*   **Compare Mode (Frontend):** Design and implement. Blocked by core refactor.
*   **Configuration CRUD (Future):** UI/API for managing constitutions.
*   **Output Superego (Future):** Implement output screening agent.
*   **Inner Agent Variety (Future):** Add more inner agent options.

## 3. Known Issues / Risks

*   **Complexity of LangGraph API:** Requires careful verification.
*   **Complexity of Stream Processing:** Implementing the logic in `streamProcessor.ts` to correctly handle all intermediate SSE events (chunks, tool calls/results) and reconstruct message state accurately requires careful attention to detail.
*   **Old `localStorage` Data:** Will be discarded. (Acceptable).
*   **Minimal Error Handling:** Focus on core demo functionality. (Acceptable).
*   ~~`ConstitutionSelector` Refactor: Needs completion (use stores, dispatch config).~~ (Completed)
*   ~~`ChatInterface` Placeholder: Still uses placeholder `RunConfig` in `handleSend`.~~ (Completed - uses `chatService`)

## 4. Decision Evolution

*   **Shift to Checkpoint-Centric State:** Decision remains firm.
*   **Formalized Coding Standards & Refactoring Order:** Explicit guidelines added/refined. Order adjusted to API -> Transformation -> UI.
*   **Tool Naming:** Corrected Superego tool name to `superego_decision`.
*   **Focus on Research Transparency:** User experience goals remain focused on observability.
*   **Backend API Structure:** Confirmed use of FastAPI routers.
*   **State Management Refinement:** Adopted `threadCacheStore` with `ThreadCacheData`.
*   **Constitution Handling:** Shifted from component-level fetch to global store (`globalConstitutionsStore`). Refactored sending logic into `chatService.ts`.
