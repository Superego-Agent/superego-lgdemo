# Progress: Superego LangGraph Agent (As of 2025-04-09 Evening)

## 1. What Works / Completed

*   **Core Backend Concept (CLI):** Initial CLI version exists.
*   **Basic Moderation:** Superego agent concept exists.
*   **Pluggable Inner Agent:** Architecture supports this.
*   **Frontend Foundation:** SvelteKit project setup exists.
*   **Initial Refactor Steps (Frontend State - As per `refactor_plan.md` log):**
    *   Core state stores (`uiSessions`, `knownThreadIds`, `activeSessionId`) defined.
    *   Type definitions (`global.d.ts`) updated.
    *   Session management logic (`sessionManager.ts`) created.
    *   Sidebar component (`Sidebar.svelte`) refactored.
    *   Logging utilities (`utils.ts`) improved.
    *   API interaction layer (`api.ts`) refactored (`getLatestHistory`, `getFullHistory`, `streamRun`).
    *   SSE types (`global.d.ts`) updated.
*   **Backend API Verification & Cleanup:**
    *   Verified backend API endpoints match `refactor_plan.md`.
    *   Refactored `backend_server_async.py` to use FastAPI routers.
*   **Plan Documentation:**
    *   Updated `refactor_plan.md` with the refined state management strategy (`historyCacheStore`, direct optimistic updates) and refactoring order.
    *   Updated `activeContext.md` to reflect the current plan and learnings.

## 2. What's Left / In Progress

*   **Frontend State Refactor (In Progress - Following Revised Order):**
    1.  **Define `historyCacheStore`:** Add store to `stores.ts`. (Next Step)
    2.  **Implement Stream Processor:** Create `streamProcessor.ts` with pure functions for handling intermediate SSE events.
    3.  **Integrate API:** Update `api.ts` (`streamRun`) to use `streamProcessor` and update `historyCacheStore`.
    4.  **Refactor UI Components:** Update `ChatInterface.svelte`, `ConstitutionSelector.svelte`, etc., to use the cache and new logic.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test the refactored frontend workflows.
*   **Compare Mode (Frontend):** Design and implement. Blocked by core refactor.
*   **Configuration CRUD (Future):** UI/API for managing constitutions.
*   **Output Superego (Future):** Implement output screening agent.
*   **Inner Agent Variety (Future):** Add more inner agent options.

## 3. Known Issues / Risks

*   **Complexity of LangGraph API:** Requires careful verification.
*   **Complexity of Stream Processing:** Implementing the logic in `streamProcessor.ts` to correctly handle all intermediate SSE events (chunks, tool calls/results) and reconstruct message state accurately requires careful attention to detail.
*   **Old `localStorage` Data:** Will be discarded. (Acceptable).
*   **Minimal Error Handling:** Focus on core demo functionality. (Acceptable).
*   **`ConstitutionSelector` Refactor:** Needs implementation to provide `RunConfig`.

## 4. Decision Evolution

*   **Shift to Checkpoint-Centric State:** Decision remains firm.
*   **Formalized Coding Standards & Refactoring Order:** Explicit guidelines added/refined. Order adjusted to API -> Transformation -> UI.
*   **Tool Naming:** Corrected Superego tool name to `superego_decision`.
*   **Focus on Research Transparency:** User experience goals remain focused on observability.
*   **Backend API Structure:** Confirmed use of FastAPI routers.
*   **State Management Refinement:** Iterated through several approaches (separate streaming store, active entry store) before settling on the `historyCacheStore` with direct optimistic updates and UI components deriving state via props/cache subscription, based on user feedback emphasizing simplicity and avoiding unnecessary stores.
