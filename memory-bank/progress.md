# Progress: Superego LangGraph Agent (As of 2025-04-09 Late Evening)

## 1. What Works / Completed

*   **Core Backend Concept (CLI):** Initial CLI version exists.
*   **Basic Moderation:** Superego agent concept exists.
*   **Pluggable Inner Agent:** Architecture supports this.
*   **Frontend Foundation:** SvelteKit project setup exists.
*   **Initial Refactor Steps (Frontend State - As per `refactor_plan.md` log):**
    *   Core state stores (`uiSessions`, `knownThreadIds`, `activeSessionId`) defined.
    *   Type definitions (`global.d.ts`) updated.
    *   Session management logic (`sessionManager.ts`) created.
    *   Sidebar component (`Sidebar.svelte`) refactored.
    *   Logging utilities (`utils.ts`) improved.
    *   API interaction layer (`api.ts`) refactored (`getLatestHistory`, `getFullHistory`, `streamRun`).
    *   SSE types (`global.d.ts`) updated.
*   **Backend API Implementation & Refinement:**
    *   Verified backend API endpoints match `refactor_plan.md`.
    *   Refactored `backend_server_async.py` to use FastAPI routers.
    *   Added `prepare_sse_event` helper to `utils.py`.
    *   Updated `api_routers/runs.py` to send required `run_start` SSE event using the helper.
    *   Updated `backend_models.py` with `SSERunStartData`.
*   **Plan Documentation:**
    *   Updated `refactor_plan.md` with the refined state management strategy (`historyCacheStore`, `run_start` event requirement) and refactoring order.
    *   Updated `activeContext.md` to reflect the current plan, progress, and learnings.
*   **Frontend State Foundation:**
    *   Added `historyCacheStore` to `src/lib/stores.ts`.

## 2. What's Left / In Progress

*   **Frontend State Refactor (In Progress - Handoff):**
    1.  **Implement Stream Processor:** Create `src/lib/streamProcessor.ts` with pure functions (`handleChunk`, `handleToolChunk`, `handleToolResult`) expecting valid `HistoryEntry` input. **(Next Step - Handed Off)**
    2.  **Integrate API:** Update `api.ts` (`streamRun`) to handle `run_start` event, initialize cache, call processor functions, update cache, and fetch final state on end.
    3.  **Refactor UI Components:** Update `ChatInterface.svelte`, `ConstitutionSelector.svelte`, etc., to use the cache and new API logic.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test the refactored frontend workflows once implemented.
*   **Compare Mode (Frontend):** Design and implement. Blocked by core refactor.
*   **Configuration CRUD (Future):** UI/API for managing constitutions.
*   **Output Superego (Future):** Implement output screening agent.
*   **Inner Agent Variety (Future):** Add more inner agent options.

## 3. Known Issues / Risks

*   **Complexity of LangGraph API:** Requires careful verification.
*   **Complexity of Stream Processing:** Implementing the logic in `streamProcessor.ts` to correctly handle all intermediate SSE events (chunks, tool calls/results) and reconstruct message state accurately requires careful attention to detail.
*   **Old `localStorage` Data:** Will be discarded. (Acceptable).
*   **Minimal Error Handling:** Focus on core demo functionality. (Acceptable).
*   **`ConstitutionSelector` Refactor:** Needs implementation to provide `RunConfig`.

## 4. Decision Evolution

*   **Shift to Checkpoint-Centric State:** Decision remains firm.
*   **Formalized Coding Standards & Refactoring Order:** Explicit guidelines added/refined. Order adjusted to API -> Transformation -> UI.
*   **Tool Naming:** Corrected Superego tool name to `superego_decision`.
*   **Focus on Research Transparency:** User experience goals remain focused on observability.
*   **Backend API Structure:** Confirmed use of FastAPI routers.
*   **State Management Refinement:** Iterated through several approaches before settling on the `historyCacheStore` with direct optimistic updates, UI components deriving state via props/cache subscription, and backend sending `run_start` event with `runConfig` for reliable initialization.
