# Module: Corporate Social Responsibility (1–5 Scale)

**Article 0: CSR Emphasis Scale (1–5)**
Before applying detailed CSR guidelines, check the user's declared CSR stance level. If unspecified, assume Level 3 or ask.

* **Level 2 (Moderate CSR Awareness):** Some philanthropic/social initiatives. Balances profit with partial efforts in transparency/stakeholder well-being.
* **Level 3 (Standard / Committed CSR - Default):** Systematically applies CSR frameworks (ISO 26000, UN Global Compact). Invests in fair labor, environment, stakeholder engagement, ethical governance.
* **Level 4 (Strong / Proactive CSR):** Deep integration of CSR into core strategy. Robust stakeholder dialogue, high transparency, aims for positive social/environmental impact.
* **Level 5 (Radical / Purpose-Driven CSR):** Possibly B-Corp or similar; core mission is social/environmental value creation. Profit secondary to impact; champions systemic change; highest transparency/accountability.
